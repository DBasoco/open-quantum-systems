This readme needs to describe how to run the project. See previous project. The `requirements.txt` file is minimal for running the jupyter notebooks for amplitude damping, depolarizing/Pauli channels, and reservoir engineering. I have not tried to run the Bloch plot functions because of many unused imports.

By the way, we also need to create a separate spreadsheet again with the approximate time logs.

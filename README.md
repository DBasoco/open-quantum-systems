# open-quantum-systems

## Introduction
This repository contains code for simulating open quantum systems in Qiskit based on the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0235-y#citeas) by Guillermo García-Pérez, Matteo A. C. Rossi & Sabrina Maniscalco. The code is written in Python 3.11.6 and uses Qiskit 0.45.0.

## Installation
To run the code, you need to install the required packages in `requirements.txt`.

## Usage
There are various directories with jupyter notebooks to reproduce the results. Some notebooks require an IBM Quantum Experience token to be saved to your computer.
